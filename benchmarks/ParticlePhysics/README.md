# Particle Physics and Nuclear Engineering

English | [简体中文](./README_zh-CN.md)

## 1. Domain Background
Particle physics and nuclear technology involve the study of fundamental particles and their interactions. In modern large-scale scientific engineering (e.g., high-energy particle colliders, cosmic ray detection, nuclear radiation monitoring), the layout of detector arrays, the setting of data filtering thresholds, and the control of accelerator parameters often face extremely complex physical constraints and high economic costs.

Introducing AI Agents to solve open-ended optimization problems in this domain can significantly reduce engineering and trial-and-error costs while ensuring physical objectives (such as statistical significance and signal-to-noise ratio) are met.
