# Task 02: CVaR Stress-Controlled Allocation

This benchmark focuses on tail-risk-aware optimization under scenario returns.
The optimizer must satisfy return and exposure constraints while minimizing CVaR.

## Why this task matters

Production portfolios are often constrained by drawdown and stress mandates.
Variance alone is not enough for heavy-tailed markets, so scenario-based CVaR
optimization is widely used in risk committees.

## Environment Setup

Please install dependencies using the unified Task configuration:

```bash
pip install -r benchmarks/PyPortfolioOpt/requirements.txt
```

If you are running commands from this subfolder, use:

```bash
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```

## Run

From repository root:

```bash
conda run -n pyportfolioopt python benchmarks/PyPortfolioOpt/cvar_stress_control/verification/evaluate.py
```

Run with `frontier_eval` unified task:

```bash
conda run -n frontier-eval-2 python -m frontier_eval \
  task=unified \
  task.benchmark=PyPortfolioOpt/cvar_stress_control \
  task.runtime.conda_env=pyportfolioopt \
  algorithm.iterations=0
```

Runtime note: this evaluator repeatedly solves CVaR programs across seeds. A single `algorithm.iterations=0` run is typically around 9-18 seconds, and longer evolutionary runs should budget minutes.
